## Slide 1: Title Slide

Content:

FairGate
The First Reputation-Gated Token Launchpad on Solana

Built with FairScale API
By [Your Name]

[Date]


**Use Screenshot #1: Homepage**
- Crop to focus on logo and main headline
- Keep the hero section visible
- Ensure tagline "The Reputation-Gated Token Launchpad" is prominent



## Slide 2: The Problem

Content:

Current Token Launches Are Broken

❌ Bots dominate allocations within seconds
❌ Sybil attacks with hundreds of fake wallets
❌ Whales crowd out retail investors
❌ New wallets with zero history can participate
❌ No verification of real vs fake users

Result: 70%+ of launch participants are bots or farmers
Real users get unfair access to new tokens


**Create Design Mockup**
- Use Canva/Figma to create problem illustration
- Show bot vs real user comparison
- Add statistics: 70% bots, 30% real users
- Use red X marks and warning icons



## Slide 3: The Solution

Content:

FairGate: Merit-Based Token Distribution

🛡️ Reputation Gating
Only wallets with proven on-chain activity can participate

⚖️ Fair Allocation
Distribution weighted by FairScore, not just capital

🎯 Tiered Access
Bronze → Silver → Gold → Platinum
Progressive benefits based on reputation

📊 Transparent Scoring
Users see exactly how their score is calculated


**Use Screenshot #3: Dashboard**
- Show the full dashboard with score cards (FairScore, Wallet Score, Social Score)
- Feature breakdown chart visible
- Bronze tier badge shown
- This demonstrates transparent scoring



## Slide 4: How It Works

Content:

Simple 4-Step Process

1. Connect Wallet
   User connects Solana wallet (Phantom, Solflare, etc.)

2. Get Scored
   FairScale API analyzes 10+ on-chain metrics
   • Transaction history
   • DeFi activity (staking, lending, swaps)
   • NFT holdings and trading
   • Wallet age
   • And more...

3. Receive Tier
   Bronze (0-25) → Silver (26-50) → Gold (51-75) → Platinum (76-100)

4. Access Launches
   Participate in tier-gated launches with score-weighted allocations


**Use Multiple Screenshots**
- **Step 1**: Use Screenshot #7 (Wallet Selection Modal showing Phantom, MetaMask, Solflare, OKX)
- **Step 2**: Crop from Screenshot #3 (Feature Breakdown section)
- **Step 3**: Use Screenshot #2 (Tier cards)
- **Step 4**: Crop from Screenshot #4 (LaunchCard)
- Arrange in 2x2 grid or flow diagram in Figma

✓ NFT holdings & trading activity
✓ Staking participation
✓ Wallet age & consistency
✓ Token diversity
✓ Smart contract interactions
✓ Governance participation
✓ Social signals
✓ Network effects

API Endpoints Used:
/score - Individual wallet scoring
/walletscore - Batch wallet analysis
/fairscore - Comprehensive reputation data


**Use Screenshot #3: Dashboard (Feature Breakdown)**
- Crop to focus on the "Feature Breakdown" section
- Shows LST Holdings, Major Tokens, Native SOL, Stablecoins, Transactions, Active Days, Median Gap
- Add architecture diagram in Figma: Browser → API Routes → FairScale
- Overlay FairScale API logo



## Slide 7: Competitive Advantage

Content:

Why FairGate Wins

vs Traditional Launchpads:
✅ Reputation gating vs First-come-first-served
✅ Bot-resistant vs Bot-dominated
✅ Merit-based vs Capital-based only
✅ Transparent scoring vs Opaque selection

vs Other Solutions:
✅ Solana-native (fast, cheap transactions)
✅ FairScale integration (proven reputation system)
